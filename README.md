# Overview
Minesweeper implementation from CTCI 6th edition.

**WIP**

# Commands
- run `./gradlew run`

## Gameplay
- `solution` to print solution grid
- `exit` to exit
- `1,1` to "click" grid 1,1

After making a move `+` means there no mine. `?` means unknown (unopened). The rest is like the original GUI game.

# Problem at the moment
"Click" opens up almost all of the map. I am not yet sure how the game intends to open up the map and will fix  shortly.

# Features Missing
Flagging not available.
